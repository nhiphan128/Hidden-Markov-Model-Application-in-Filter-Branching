# Hidden-Markov-Model-Application-in-Filter-Branching
Working together on an exciting hidden Markov model simulation project, Nhi and Jayaram have decided to use it to study a straightforward yet fascinating weather case. Their main goal is to calculate the likelihood that a day will be sunny or rainy on day "t" in light of all the information and variables that have been observed up to that time.

In this simulation, the observed variables or evidence they are considering are quite relatable to our daily lives. For instance, they're taking into account whether a friend comes in with an umbrella or not, a scenario many of us can easily relate to. Additionally, they're incorporating data from a weather sensor that provides readings of humidity levels. These real-world cues are pivotal in making predictions about the weather conditions for each day.

Their methodology, though, is what particularly intrigues me about their undertaking. Particle filtering has been picked by Nhi and Jayaram as their method of choice. Particle filtering is a method for estimating states and uncertainty in probabilistic graphical models, such as hidden Markov models. They hope to develop a reliable model using this cutting-edge technique that can correctly forecast whether a day will be sunny or cloudy using a mix of observed variables, historical data, and probabilistic calculations.

Nhi and Jayaram are working to uncover the mysteries of the data and produce more accurate weather forecasts by combining their knowledge of hidden Markov models and particle filtering. These forecasts will take into account not only scientific measurements but also commonplace observations like umbrellas and humidity levels. With the help of this creative effort, we may better comprehend how to use cutting-edge statistical methods to understand the world around us.
