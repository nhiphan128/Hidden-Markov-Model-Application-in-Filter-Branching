Forward Algorithm:
Compute the likelihood of observations given the model parameters.
Example: In speech recognition, how likely a specific speech signal is given the acoustic model of the speaker.

Viterbi Algorithm:
Find most likely sequence of hidden states given the observations.
Example: Whether the person carries an umbrella or not, determine most likely sequence of hidden states (Sunny or Rainy) 

Particle Filtering:
Non-linear dynamics, non-Gaussian noise, or you need to estimate the full posterior distribution of states over time.
Example: Simultaneous localization and mapping (estimate its position and create a map of the environment ). Vaccum/Mop robot
